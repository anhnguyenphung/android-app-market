## Introduction
After finishing the track Data Science with Python on DataCamp, I decided to do this project on DataCamp to sharpen my skill of exploratory data analysis before jumping into
practicing applying machine learning models with different data.

## Skill gained through this project
* Importing and cleaning data.
* Data visulization with matplotlib and seaborn.
* Data manipulation with pandas.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Details can be found in my [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/anhnguyenphung/android-app-market/blob/master/notebook.ipynb).
